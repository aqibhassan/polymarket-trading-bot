# Singularity Ensemble Strategy Configuration
# Combines 5 signal sources for defensible alpha
#
# RE-OPTIMIZED: 2026-02-09 via fast_optimize.py (corrected ensemble logic)
# Dataset: 1,052,641 1m candles (Feb 2024 - Feb 2026), 70,176 windows
# Sweep: 4,608 parameter combinations with corrected ensemble:
#   - Time-of-day votes neutral (confidence boost only, not directional)
#   - effective_min floor of 2 (always require multi-source confirmation)
#   - cum_return == 0 guard (skip flat candles)
#
# Best balanced config (Sharpe * sqrt(trades)):
#   Sharpe=2.79, WinRate=93.0%, Trades=55,812, MaxDD=2.0%, PF=12.86
#   Net PnL=$9,138,450 on $200/trade fixed sizing
#
# Best by win rate (500+ trades):
#   WinRate=97.1%, Sharpe=2.48, Trades=16,445, MaxDD=0.5%, PF=32.21
#   (uses min_confidence=0.70, weight_momentum=0.80, time_filter=off, last3=on)
